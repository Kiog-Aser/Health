cd HealthTrackerPro

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Production Deployment

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
RUN npm run build

FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js ./
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## PWA Installation

### Desktop Browsers

3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. Confirm installation

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for environment-specific configuration:

```bash
# Optional: Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your-google-analytics-id

# Optional: Error tracking
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn

# Optional: Database (when implemented)
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string

# Optional: Authentication (when implemented)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=your-app-url

## Performance Optimization

### Lighthouse Scores Target
- **Performance**: 90+
- **Accessibility**: 95+
- **Best Practices**: 95+
- **SEO**: 90+
- **PWA**: 100

### Optimizations Included
- âœ… Image optimization with Next.js Image component (ready)
- âœ… Static generation for better performance
- âœ… Automatic code splitting
- âœ… PWA with service worker
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Modern CSS with Tailwind

## Security Considerations

### Headers Configuration
The app includes security headers in `next.config.js`:
- Content Security Policy
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy

### HTTPS
- Always deploy with HTTPS enabled
- Use Vercel or Netlify for automatic SSL certificates
- For self-hosting, use Let's Encrypt or CloudFlare

## Backup & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly
- [ ] Monitor security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review Lighthouse scores
- [ ] Update PWA manifest as needed
- [ ] Test offline functionality

### Backup Strategy (Future)
- Database backups (when implemented)
- Environment variables backup
- Source code in version control

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build
```

**PWA Not Installing**
- Check manifest.json is accessible
- Verify HTTPS is enabled
- Ensure service worker is registered

**Styling Issues**
- Verify Tailwind is configured correctly
- Check for CSS conflicts
- Use browser dev tools for debugging
